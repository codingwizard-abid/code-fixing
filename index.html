                    <h2>How does javascript work?</h2>
                    <p><b>Answer:</b> Javascript is a high-level and first-class functional programming language. It is only one language that can run on the browser. Behind the scene, Javascript code is executed by an engine called a V8 engine(chrome). The V8 engine is a program that executes javascript code on the browser and node js. Javascript engine use JIT or Just-in-time compilation where entire code is converted into machine code at once then immediately executed. There are two things in the javascript engine one is call-stack and another one is memory heap. On call-stack an execution happened is an execution context that means all functions are stored before one another and the top stored function executes first then follows this sequence. On the other hand, a memory heap is a box or container where all objects are stored. Above all javascript is an object-oriented programming language that means codes can be split into multiple pieces but every code relates to one another such as prototypical inheritance for building big applications.</p>

                    <h2>What does javascript event loop do?</h2>
                    <p><b>Answer:</b> Javascript is a single-threaded programming language. It has only one thread of execution. Unlike java, javascript can not execute multiple pieces of code at once. Next, there are many web APIs that are provided to browsers but not in the core language itself. After that, there is a callback queue. It is a data structure that holds all the ready-to-executed callback functions attached to some event. Then call-stack execute these functions. And finally, this is an event loop that javascript does in an asynchronous behavior. Gathering and processing events, and executing queued sub-program, it shows us the feeling of multi-threading. The event queue's task is to send new functions for preparation. It looks after the queue data structure to keep on the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. For example, the setTimeout method. While a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack, it is sent to the related API which waits until the specified time to send this operation for processing.</p>
